#short circuit values
##logical operators are processed left to right. They "short-circuit" (stop) as
##soon as they have a result -
##but they return the value that stopped the processing
##(not necessarily true or false)

## logical operators will not always return true because:
## they return the value that stopped processing
## that value might have been treated as truthy falsy although it was not a Boolean.

##(programmers will use this creatively,
##for example, to set values for variables or even create objects)
